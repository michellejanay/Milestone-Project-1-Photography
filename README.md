## UX

### Project Goals
As part of Code Institute's Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development, I was tasked with creating a webpage using HTML, CSS, and optionally Bootstrap. I decided to take the perspective of a Web Design/Development agency who has a client that is a photographer in need of a website to display their work. 

### User Stories
From the perspective of the client:

1. As a photographer, I want to organize my photos into a gallery, so visitors can easily browse through my portfolio.

2. As a photographer, I want to add location description to my photos, so they are easily searchable.

3. As a photographer, I want to update my biography and contact information, so potential clients can learn more about me and reach out.

4. As a photographer, I want to manage client inquiries through a contact form, so I can respond to potential clients efficiently.

From the perspective of the visitor:

1. As a visitor, I want to view the photographer's portfolio, so I can see the quality and style of their work.

2. As a visitor, I want to read the photographer's biography, so I can learn more about their background and expertise.

3. As a visitor, I want to follow the photographer on social media, so I can stay updated on their latest work and news.

4. As a visitor, I want the website to be responsive, so it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

5. As a visitor, I want to navigate through the site easily with a clear menu, so I can find information without getting lost.


### Design Choices
To make the images pop, I decided to go with a dark themed web design. I went with an offblack color with white text, so that the contrast is not as harsh on the eyes and is still accessible. I chose a typewriter font for headings, and source sans 3 for all other text.

### Wireframes

## Features
The website contains a landing page, an about page, a gallery page, and a contact page. Some of the images were already black and white, but for consistency I gave all images a filter of grayscale and a hover effect that will change the colour images back to colour.

## Technologies Used
GitPod, GitHub, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## Testing
HTML Validator, CSS Validator, Lighthouse, any bugs?
One bug I faced when building this website was the image loading time. Below are screenshots of the issues I was facing, specifically concerning the images. Some things I did to fix this was to save the images as webp format, resizing the images to a smaller format, and compressing the images using https://tinypng.com/.
