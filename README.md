## UX

### Project Goals
As part of Code Institute's Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development, I was tasked with creating a webpage using HTML, CSS, and optionally Bootstrap. I decided to take the perspective of a Web Design/Development agency who has a client that is a photographer in need of a website to display their work.
